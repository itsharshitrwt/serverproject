## ðŸ”¥ "Infrastructure as Code in Action: Deploying Nginx with Terraform & Ansible"

This project aimed to automate the deployment and configuration of an Nginx web server using Terraform, Docker, and Ansible, ensuring a fully automated infrastructure setup. Terraform provisioned the Docker container, Docker ran the Nginx server, and Ansible customized its configuration dynamically. Through this, I learned how to integrate these tools effectively, troubleshoot infrastructure automation issues, and handle dependencies like Python inside containers. For more advanced implementations, I will introduce Kubernetes for container orchestration, CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment, and cloud providers (AWS, GCP) to scale the infrastructure dynamically. ðŸš€
